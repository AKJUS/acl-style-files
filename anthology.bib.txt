Please download the latest anthology.bib from the following URL:

    http://aclanthology.org/anthology.bib

From the command line, this can be done with curl or wget. 

If you are using Overleaf, there is an issue in that the consolidated file is over its
50 MB limit. To address this, we have split the Anthology bib files into multiple chunks.
Currently, there are two: 
- https://aclanthology.org/anthology-overleaf-1.bib (2024 and before)
- https://aclanthology.org/anthology-overleaf-2.bib (2025 and afterwards)
You can download these directly from Overleaf from New File -> From External URL,
and then adding them to the \bibliography line in acl_latex.tex:

    \bibliography{custom,anthology-overleaf-1,anthology-overleaf-2}
